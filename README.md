# E-commerce_Sql_project
This project demonstrates the design and analysis of an e-commerce database using SQL.
It includes:

A complete database schema (DDL) for products, customers, orders, reviews, shipping, discounts, and coupons.

Over 50 SQL queries for business insights such as top-selling products, customer lifetime value, discount analysis, and shipping performance.
